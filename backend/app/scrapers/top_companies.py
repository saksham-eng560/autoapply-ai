"""Internships at renowned companies: big tech, product-based companies, top Indian and global startups and AI
companies (services/company_catalog.py).

Companies with their own Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby board or Workday site are read straight from it; the
ones that hire through their own career site (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Flipkart...) are found with a
LinkedIn search for "<company> intern", keeping only that company's postings. Only internships are kept,
filtered by your target roles. All of it runs in parallel within the scan's time limit; a board that has
moved is skipped.
